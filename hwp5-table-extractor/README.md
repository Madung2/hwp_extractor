(venv) $ python cli.py <INPUT_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE>
```

## Notes

Supported output format is HTML only for now, but you can still access to the table
structure through `Table` object. It has `list` of rows and each row consists
of `list` of `TableCell`s.

So, the entire structure looks like:

```
<class Table>
    .row_cnt = XX
    .col_cnt = XX
    .rows = [
        [<class TableCell>, <class TableCell>, ...],
        [<class TableCell>, <class TableCell>, ...],
        ...
    ]

<class TableCell>
    .lines = ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3', ...]
    .row = XX
    .col = XX
    .row_span = XX
    .col_span = XX
```

Note that each row can have different numbers of cell because of `row_span`s
and `col_span`s.
